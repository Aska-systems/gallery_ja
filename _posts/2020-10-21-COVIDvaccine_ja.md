上の図は、パレットダイアグラムという図で、各回答者の回答パターンを可視化したものです。
回答者が横一列に並べられ、縦軸方向に回答パターンが記されています。

- およそ20%の人が、今回の質問とは直接関係ない回答をしています（**Not directly related to vaccine**とラベル付けされています）が、多くの人がこれらの回答に反応したため、無効回答とせずに残してあります。
また、ワクチンと関係しているものの、はっきりとラベル付けできない回答もいくつかありました (**Unknown**)。
以下では、図中でこれらに対応する緑色・オレンジ色の部分は無視していくことにします。
- 全体的に、ワクチン接種に対して肯定的な回答が多いですが、すぐさま受けたいという人はあまりいないようです。[**Yes** and **Yes, if it is ensured to be safe**]
- 結構な割合の回答者が、受けない・少し待つ（**No** and **Wait for a while**）を支持していることも分かります。
- また、いくらかの回答者は、政治的な介入について懐疑的な考えを持っているようです。(**Political influences**)
- 初期状態での回答はないため、すべての回答は回答者から自発的に出現したものです。

    I'm very concerned about a vaccine being approved strictly for political purposes and then being given to the public without sufficient trials. If proper procedure is followed, however, I'll get that vaccine as soon as it's available.

    There is very low risk of me contracting Covid in my small, rural town. I am healthy, so there is very low risk of a Covid infection negatively impacting my health. I will wait a year or two until it has been proven safe and effective in real world use.
